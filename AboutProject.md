CREATE HACKERRANK CHALLENGE WITH AUTOMATION

In this project I created a automated hakcerrank challenge using puppeteer.

How it works :

We have a object file which contains different problems.
With the help of Nodejs we automate the process of creating challenge.
It select problems from object file one by one and add that in challenge.
It also add moderator name in the challenges.

Technology Used : Nodejs & Puppeteer
