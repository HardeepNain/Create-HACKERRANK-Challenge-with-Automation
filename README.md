# Create HACKERRANK Challenge with Automation

In this project I created a automated hakcerrank challenge using puppeteer.

## Working 📝

- We have a object file which contains different problems.
- With the help of Nodejs we automate the process of creating challenge.
- It select problems from object file one by one and add that in challenge.
- It also add moderator name in the challenges.
